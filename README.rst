Examples of how to upload gzip-compressed HTTP **requests** to a web server
and process these requests on the server.

Background
==========

There's a lot of misleading snippets on the Internet about this topic, as
we learned when we tried to implement the ability to gzip data uploaded
from our clients to the cloud.

While there are clear standards on how to gzip data in an HTTP response
(such as when compressing HTML and CSS to send to a web browser) there
doesn't appear to be a standard approach to gzip the data in an HTTP
request.

We developed a convention internally of using the ``Content-Encoding:``
header on the HTTP request to ``gzip`` (which mirrors ``Accept-Encoding:`` on
browser requests and the resulting ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` on the response
that follows). This also makes the process transparent to underlying
``Content-Type:`` headers.  Our payloads were JSON but this could easily be
used for XML or any other text-like data.

In testing it also became apparent that very small requests (like small
responses) grow when gzip compressed. It's probably best to put a *minimum*
bound on content lengths that you will compress --  100-150 bytes is
reasonable.

Use At Your Own Risk
====================

Using this bare-minimum code, there's a huge potential for a denial of
service attack since your application server will continue to accept gzip
content until it runs out of memory.
